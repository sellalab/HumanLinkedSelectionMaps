#### NOTES ON INSTALLATION ISSUES ####

(these notes may or may not be helpful depending on your system)

gsl-1.16 installed without issue

glib-2.42.2 has several dependencies:
	1)pkg-config (done)
	2)libffi (done)
	3)GNU gettext()
	--once these are installed the ./configure in glib seems to work fine..

zlib-1.2.8 installed without issue


making edits to the following lines of the makefile in original scripts package:

# The pre-processor and compiler options.
MY_CFLAGS = -I/ifs/data/c2b2/gs_lab/shared/software/gsl-1.16/include/gsl/ $(shell pkg-config --cflags glib-2.0) 
**changed to:
(should be correct- matches the directory in the cluster version)
MY_CFLAGS = /usr/local/include/gsl/ $(shell pkg-config --cflags glib-2.0) 

# The linker options.
MY_LIBS   = -L/ifs/data/c2b2/gs_lab/shared/software/gsl-1.16/lib/ -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm -lz $(shell pkg-config --libs glib-2.0)
**changed to:
MY_LIBS   = /usr/local/include/ -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm -lz $(shell pkg-config --libs glib-2.0)

ERROR MESSAGE:
aa.d:1: *** missing separator.  Stop.
possibly due to incorrect echo functionality ignoring -n newline suppression. replacing with printf
--THIS WORKS! :-)
