This is a modified version of McVicker's C code 
to pre-calculate maps of the effects of background
selection. 

Initial modifications were made by Guy Amster and
Eyal Elyashiv and saved on the cluster in the
shared folder: /ifs/data/c2b2/gs_lab/shared/guy/B-maps/src.

In this version I will attempt to modify the code 
in order to return pre-exponentiated "little" 
B values on the log scale instead of the discrete
bins used for big B values that were used earlier
(see Elyashiv et al, 2016)
